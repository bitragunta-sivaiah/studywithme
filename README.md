## 🤔 Why StudyWithMe?

Standard productivity timers are functional but often bland and rigid. **StudyWithMe** is built on the idea that your focus environment should be as aesthetic and personal as your workspace.

It combines a powerful Pomodoro timer, a world clock, and a stopwatch into one beautiful interface, giving you complete control over the look and sound. From custom background images to 10 different clock fonts and text-to-speech alerts, you can craft the perfect "study vibe" that works for you.
