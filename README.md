From custom background images to 10 different clock fonts and text-to-speech alerts, you can craft the perfect "study vibe" that works for you.✨ FeaturesCategoryFeaturesTimer Suite🍅 Pomodoro Timer: Fully customizable work, short break, and long break intervals.⏱️ Stopwatch: A high-precision stopwatch.⏳ Countdown: A simple quick-set countdown timer.Personalization🎨 Background Themes: 8+ built-in gradients, custom image upload, and an auto-theme that changes with the time of day (morning/afternoon/evening/night).💡 Brightness Control: A global slider to dim the interface for late-night sessions.Clock Themes💅 10 Digital Themes: Instantly change the font and color of all timers (Neon, Retro, Matrix, etc.).🕰️ 10 Analog Themes: A full-face analog clock with 10 unique styles (Minimal, Modern, Royal, etc.).👀 Live Previews: See your clock themes in the settings before you apply them.Audio Control🔉 Sound Alerts: Choose from 9 built-in sounds.🗣️ Text-to-Speech: Type a custom message (e.g., "Time's up, John!") to be spoken as your alert.📤 Custom Upload: Upload your own MP3/WAV file for a truly personal alert.🎚️ Volume Control: Adjust the alert volume from silent to loud.World Clock🌍 Timezone Support: A full-featured clock with a searchable list of all global timezones.🔄 12/24 Hour Format: Toggle to your preferred format.Usability💾 Persistent Settings: Your preferences are automatically saved to your browser's local storage.🍪 Cookie Consent: A clean, one-time consent banner.🛠️ Tech StackThis project was built using a modern frontend stack:AreaTechnologyPurposeCoreUI & Application LogicStylingUtility-First CSS FrameworkAnimationPage transitions and UI animationsAudioAudio playback, scheduling, and volume controlDate/TimeTimezone manipulation and date formattingIconsModern & lightweight icon setDeploymentHosting🚀 Running LocallyWant to run this project on your own machine?Clone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
